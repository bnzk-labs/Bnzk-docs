# Tokenomics



BNZK is the native token of the Bnzk network - the first ZK proof network for Bitcoin. It is used to pay for network fees, secure the network, and incentivize participants in the Bnzk ecosystem.

The total supply of BNZK tokens is 100 million. The tokenomics are as follows:

* **Team reserve:** 10% of the tokens are reserved for the Bnzk team. These tokens will be used to fund the development and growth of the Bnzk network.
* **Ecosystem rewards:** 20% of the tokens are allocated to reward ecosystem and community participants. This includes developers, contributors, and users of the Bnzk network.
* **Public sale and private sale:** 40% of the tokens are available for purchase in public and private sales.
* **Mining rewards:** 30% of the tokens are distributed to zkProvers and zkValidators who secure the Bnzk network.

Here are some of the benefits of using BNZK tokens:

* **Decentralization:** BNZK tokens are a decentralized asset that powers a large distributed ZK network and incentivizes the network participants.
* **Security:** BNZK tokens are used to secure the Bnzk network. This means that they are held by zkProvers and zkValidators who are responsible for verifying transactions and blocks on the network.
* **Scalability:** BNZK tokens are designed to be scalable. This means that the network can handle a large number of transactions without experiencing congestion or high fees.
